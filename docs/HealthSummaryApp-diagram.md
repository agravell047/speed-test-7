# Health Summary Application Architecture Diagram

## Overview
This document provides a visual representation of the architecture of the Health Summary Application. It outlines the key components, their interactions, and the overall structure of the application.

## Components
- **Client Applications**: Frontend applications that interact with the backend service.
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests from clients to the appropriate backend services.
- **Health Summary Application**: The main backend service that aggregates and synthesizes patient data.
  - **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.
    - **HeartbeatController**: Provides a health check endpoint.
  - **Services**: Contain the business logic and interact with repositories.
  - **Repositories**: Interface with external data sources (e.g., Millennium Platform APIs).
- **Datadog Monitoring**: Monitors the application's performance and health.
- **Caching Layer**: Improves performance by storing frequently accessed data.
- **Database**: Stores persistent data related to patient health summaries.
